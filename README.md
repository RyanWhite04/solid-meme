Chrome app, forces you to write.

A chrome extension which records your browser history and integrates into Facebook.

Turn it on and if you don't write enough words within the time frame, it posts a page from your history to Facebook as punishment.

Maybe helpful for people trying nanowrimo or those with writer's block.
